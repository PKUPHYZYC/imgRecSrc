- make sure that double and float yield the same output
- use Pinned memory for transfer data between device and host
- use shared memory
- global memory access should be as close as possible between threads in 
  each block.
- use texture memory (2d)
- use constant memory
- use EPS
- size of shared memory should be made automatic

- Register, local, shared, and constant memory usages are reported by the
  compiler when compiling with the -ptxas-options=-v option.

- It may be a problem when prjFull is some arbitrary number
    fSize = min(pConf->np, pConf->prjFull/8+1)*pConf->prjWidth;

- need to divie the effectiveRate for gpuPrj.cu

- reorganize the order of multi-thread

make FBP part parallel

There is a little difference between the calculation of cpu and gpu, 
although they are small


add the parameter for the position of the rotation center's projection on
the detector array.
