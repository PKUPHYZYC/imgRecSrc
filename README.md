## Image Reconstruction Source Code

### What does this package contain

1. Accelerated Proximal-Gradient Algorithms (NPG and NPGs)

The examples about this methods are under `npgEx` folder, where the code 
can reproduce the figures appear in our paper.  Note that our figures in 
paper are generated by `GNUplot` with the `*.data` files.

The algorithm implementations are under folder `npg`, which use the small
functions under `utils` folder.

2. Beam Hardening Correction Algorithms

All examples and data for our blind beam hardening correction method are
under folder `bhcEx` with algorithm implementations under `bhc`.


### How to Install

To install this package, first download the repository by running

    git clone https://github.com/isucsp/imgRecSrc.git

after downloading, from MATLAB change your current folder to `imgRecSrc/`.
Each time before running the methods from this package, first execute
`setupPath.m` to compile and add the paths to the environment.

For X-ray CT examples, the projection and back projection operator
subroutines may be called from MATLAB. To prepare MATLAB recognizable `MEX`
file, go to `imgRecSrc/prj` and execute `make mCPUPrj` for CPU
implementation and (if you have GPU equipped) `make mGPUPrj` for GPU
implementation of the X-ray CT projection operators.

#### Install to `Linux`

If errors are reported while compiling the `*.c`/`*.cu` files under
`imgRecSrc/prj`, please edit the first few lines in
`imgRecSrc/prj/Makefile` to make sure the path for your `CUDA` installation
is correct.

#### Install in Windows

See the corresponding `*.sln` and `*.vcxproj` files, which are prepared under `Visual
Studio 2013`.
