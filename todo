be care for the mask of the wavelate, as the PsiM and PsiMt are not square.

check the convergence criteria
considering less use of operators, efficiency, i.e. SpaRSA

check the wavelet, it is very suspicious

Noticed that:

1. continuation.
2. the direct implementation continue decreasing the cost function, while
the fourier transform implementation stack at certain point, although the
two share the same path before the point.
The RSE can reach unblievable precision. 4e-5; for less than 1000 iterations


The line search for FISTA speed up the convergence in terms of number of outer
iterations.

FISTA_NNL1 and FISTA_ADMM_NNL1 are almost equivalent, which means with/without
line search, their convergence curve are the same.
